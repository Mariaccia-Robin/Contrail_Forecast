    "**Because of my current position taking a lot of my free time during the week, I only had this weekend to work on this project, so I have a lot of rushed EDA notebooks that I don’t feel are presentable. I am using this section to summarize my findings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the available data, ~64% of flights do not generate any contrails. For those that do, the CO2e impact varies greatly.  \n",
    "I therefore decided to split the problem into two parts:  \n",
    "- I will build a model to predict which flights will generate a contrail and which won’t.  \n",
    "- Using the flights that are expected to generate contrails, a second model will estimate their kgCO2e impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><b>Understanding/researching the subject</b><br><br></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using scientific papers and publicly available knowledge, I identified the factors affecting contrail creation, duration, size, and warming effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrail Creation Causes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Altitude: Needs to be high enough (typically above 8–10 km)  \n",
    "- Temperature: Needs to be low enough (below approximately -40°C)  \n",
    "- Humidity: Needs to be high enough (above approximately 70%)  \n",
    "- Engines produce varying amounts of water vapor, which increases local humidity  \n",
    "- Engines also emit particles that provide surfaces for water vapor to freeze on  \n",
    "- If multiple planes have flown the same path recently and created contrails → increased local humidity  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrail Size and Duration Causes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wind: Strong winds spread the contrail quickly, while little to no wind allows it to persist longer  \n",
    "- Distance traveled at cruising altitude: Longer distance = longer contrail  \n",
    "- Multiple planes creating contrails on the same path can merge into a larger, longer-lasting contrail (possibly forming a cirrus cloud)  \n",
    "- Atmospheric stability  \n",
    "- Humidity variation between atmospheric layers  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrail Warming/Cooling Causes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solar radiation: Contrails reflect some sunlight back to space → cooling effect  \n",
    "- Earth radiation: Contrails trap some outgoing longwave radiation → warming effect\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><b>EDA findings / Feature engineering</b><br><br></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, flights can have a cooling effect on the environment. This happens when the solar radiation reflected by the contrail is higher than the upward radiation emitted by the Earth. It occurs in the morning, when the ground is at its coolest and the Sun starts sending radiation through the atmosphere.  \n",
    "As the day progresses, contrails’ greenhouse effect increases and is at its worst at nightfall, when the Sun no longer emits radiation but the Earth is still warm from the day.  \n",
    "In the provided dataset, on average, there are 19,329 flights with an **average 15306 kgCO2e warming effect**.  \n",
    "If we cut off all flights departing after 1:00 PM, the remaining 9,283 flights have on **average a -61 kgCO2e warming effect** (which is then a cooling effect).  \n",
    "The earlier the flights, the stronger the average cooling effect becomes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Available data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cargo Capacity: Not a single cargo flight in our test set.\n",
    "- Role: All flights are commercial flights.\n",
    "- Origin Airport/Destination Airport: Useful for determining local times and latitude/longitude for precise exogenous weather/radiation data pull.\n",
    "- Take-off Time (UTC): Transformed into \"Take-off Time (Local),\" which was useful to timestamp multiple points during the flight to pull weather data from (assuming straight-line flight between both airports and using the aircraft's average speed/climb rate).\n",
    "- Date: Information already included in \"Take-off Time (UTC)\". It is interesting to note that summer flights have a much lower contrail impact than other seasons, probably because the nights are shorter and solar radiation is stronger, so the contrails’ cooling effect counterbalances the greenhouse effect.\n",
    "- Aircraft: Used to get information about flight cruise altitude/speed/climb rate.\n",
    "- Engine: Used to get particle emissions (but I could not find water vapor emissions of the engines). Although not strong, there is a clear correlation between engine types and contrail creation probability and kgCO2e.\n",
    "- Registration: No correlation\n",
    "- Seats: No correlation\n",
    "- Flight Number: Airlines can be extracted from this. Although useless for forecasting, it could be interesting from a commercial point of view to isolate airline-specific flights. If we identify an airline that pollutes significantly more than others, we could contact them with a report outlining the probable causes and suggesting ways to reduce their environmental footprint.\n",
    "- Distance OD (km): Useless since we have access to the actual distance flown, and we can already get that information from the geolocation of both airports.\n",
    "- Distance Flown (km): Almost no flight under 600 km (~3,000 flights) showed any contrail, likely due to planes not reaching cruising altitude. The longer the flight, the more likely a contrail will appear (stabilizing at around 60%), while the warming effect keeps increasing as the contrails get longer.\n",
    "- CO2 (kgCO2e): Weak correlation, likely due to confounding factors: more CO2 emission = longer flight = higher altitude, etc. → increased contrail likelihood but not directly due to CO2 emission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exogenous data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to pull weather and radiation data from 5 points during the flight:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the flight first enters the minimum altitude for contrail creation\n",
    "- When the flight enters its cruising altitude\n",
    "- Mid-flight\n",
    "- When the flight exits its cruising altitude and starts descending\n",
    "- When the flight is descending past the minimum altitude for contrail creation\n",
    "\n",
    "For those 5 coordinates and timestamps, I pulled data from ERA5 for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temperature\n",
    "- Humidity\n",
    "- Longwave radiation (outgoing thermal energy from the Earth)\n",
    "- Shortwave radiation (incoming solar energy)\n",
